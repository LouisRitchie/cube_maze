A game for Resist Jam 2017, a game jam with the theme of resisting totalitarianism through games and art that depict 
the struggle of living in under totalitarian governments, dictatorships, or other oppressive regimes.

We might make Windows, Mac, and Linux builds for this game. We might not. We'll see.
